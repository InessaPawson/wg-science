## Problem

Monitoring and analyzing contributions to large scientific open source projects currently presents a challenge due to the lack of specialized tools available and established metrics standards.

## Objectives
- Define useful metrics

- Identify best tools 

- Develop best practices and metrics standards for scientific open source projects

## Mission

SciOSS group aims to develop research-informed and peer-validated community health metrics and standards that will help scientific open source project leaders and funders better support contributors and make the impact of community focused work more visible. It will also help drive the adoption of these metrics and implementation of best practices.
